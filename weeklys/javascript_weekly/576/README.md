[Apache ECharts 5.3: Open Source JS Visualization Library](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119760/web "echarts.apache.org") — The [release notes](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119761/web) go into extensive detail about what’s in the newest release, including keyframe animations, custom loading animations, and a new SVG renderer with 2-10x improved performance.

🥊  [Move Over JavaScript? How Some Backend Languages are Coming to the Front-End](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119706/web "github.com") — You might think this is about using WebAssembly to run Python in the browser or something, but no. It’s about the growing popularity of maintaining a WebSocket connection to a backend process and rendering HTML on the fly from the backend, as seen in modern Elixir and Rails stacks.

🎧  [The JS Party Podcast](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119763/web "changelog.com") — It’s come to our attention we haven’t linked to the fine _JS Party_ podcast for a fair while, so if you haven’t been listening, there’s a lot of good stuff to catch up on. Last week they [dug into SolidJS](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119764/web), last December covered [Svelte](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119765/web), and even had a lawyer on to discuss the [legal implications of GitHub Copilot](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119766/web).

## **IN BRIEF:**

*   🤑 Few of us have sold a very basic JavaScript app for over $1m to the _New York Times._ The creator of Wordle _has_ and [▶️ talks about it on the Syntax podcast](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119708/web).
    
*   [Node.js 17.5.0](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119709/web) has landed with the experimental support for the Fetch API we mentioned last week.
    
*   The Khronos WebGL Working Group reminds us that [WebGL 2.0 is now broadly supported](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119710/web) by all major browsers, and to start migrating to it.
    
*   Popular HTTP client [`curl` has gained a `--json` option](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119711/web) you might find handy.
    
*   When a JavaScript developer decides to skip React and SPAs and [builds a Rails app instead,](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119712/web) you can expect [a bit of 'spirited discussion'](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119714/web).
    
*   As promised and on schedule, Vue 3 is now the [new default version](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119716/web) of Vue.js and [vuejs.org](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119718/web) has been updated accordingly.
