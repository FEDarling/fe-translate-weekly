## The Best of JavaScript Weekly in 2021

This is the last issue of the year (we're back on January 7, 2022) so we're taking a look back at some of the most popular items of 2021, starting with top links overall before moving on to top libraries, tools, videos, and more. You'll also find a quick month by month rundown in this issue, so there's sure to be something that'll catch your attention :-)

1.  [ES2021: Here's the Features (Quickly)](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117997/web "h3manth.com") — Back in June of this year, the Ecma General Assembly [approved ES2021](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117998/web). Work continues with [ECMAScript 2022 already having a draft spec](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117999/web). But this post flying through what's new in ES2021 (not a lot!) was _by far_ our most popular link of the year, amazingly. Dr. Axel Rauschmayer also had a popular post [rounding up ES2021](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118000/web).

[ES2021：特性速递](./es2021_new_feature.md) — 早在今年 6 月，Ecma 大会就批准了 ES2021。 有关[ECMAScript 2022 草案规范](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)工作仍在继续。但是这篇介绍 ES2021 新功能的帖子是我们今年最受欢迎的链接，挺令人惊讶的。 Axel Rauschmayer 博士还有一篇[关于 ES2021 的热门帖子](https://2ality.com/2020/09/ecmascript-2021.html)。

2.  [Comparing Svelte and React](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118001/web "www.jackfranklin.co.uk") — After spending an extended period of time working with both, the author identified his preference based on first hand observations supported with real-world examples. I suspect 2022 will continue to see Svelte taking big leaps forward.

[比较 Svelte 和 React](./svelte_vs_react.md) — 两个框架一起使用了很长一段时间后，作者根据真实示例确定了他喜欢哪个。我怀疑 2022 年 Svelte 将继续向前迈进一大步。

[Build a Mobile-Responsive Telehealth Pager App Using Stream’s Chat API](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117986/web "getstream.io") — With Direct and Group Chats, emojis & Reactions, Built-in GIF support, the ability to edit & delete messages, specialized commands, and much more, this fully responsive Medical Pager is the best Chat App that you can currently find on YouTube.

3.  [Comparing the New Generation of Build Tools](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118002/web "css-tricks.com") — A detailed evaluation of a variety of approaches for bundling JavaScript and other front-end assets, including Snowpack, esbuild, Vite, and wmr. A handy overview.

[新一代构建工具对比](./build_tools_compare.md) — 新一代构建工具对比，包括 Snowpack、esbuild、Vite 和 wmr。

4.  ['Rust is the Future of JavaScript Infrastructure'](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118003/web "leerob.io") — It’s an opinion but the (still) growing evidence is compelling. Rust (as well as Go) is now being heavily used to replace parts of the JavaScript tooling ecosystem that might have otherwise been written in JS before (e.g. Rome, SWC, dprint).

5.  [The State of Web Workers in 2021](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118004/web "www.smashingmagazine.com") — The web is single-threaded, but two years ago Surma told us [why to always use Web Workers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118005/web) and why to bring multithreading to your solutions despite the difficulties. [Almost every client supports](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118006/web) them now, so Surma made the case again.

6.  [Rethinking JavaScript's Ternary Operator](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118007/web "jrsinclair.com") — `ternary ? "yes" : "no"` … A lot of developers regard the ternary operator “with suspicion”, says James. Does its brevity warrant its use alone? Is it something you can “trust”? James also looks at a future alternative coming to the language.

[重新思考 JavaScript 的三元运算符](./ternary.md)—三元运算符 ? "true" : "false"……许多开发人员对三元运算符“持一点怀疑态度”，James 说：它的简洁性是否值得单独使用？它是你可以“信任”的东西吗？ James 还研究了该语言的未来替代方案。

[React Authentication, Simplified](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117992/web "userfront.com") — In this article, we lay out a new approach to authentication (plus access control & SSO) in React applications.
