**IN BRIEF:**

*   The [latest VS Code update](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124744/web) is out. TypeScript 4.7 is included and, more excitingly, **Go to Definition** [now jumps](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124745/web) to the JS implementation of functions and symbols in external libraries rather than the type definitions.
    
*   😆 Last week we linked to a guy who made a graphical game in Word with JavaScript using _Office Add-Ins_ - he's back again [▶️ implementing Wordle in Word.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124746/web) It's nice to see someone having some fun.
    
*   **DOOM?** We recently linked to [Sliderland](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124747/web), a curious minimalist JS coding playground – its creator has now created [a DOOM-like game](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124748/web) on top of it(!)
    
*   **SAFARI:** Apple's developer conference, WWDC, is currently underway and [new WebKit/Safari features](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124749/web) are on show in Safari 16 Beta. There's support for _Web Inspector Extensions_ and support for [_Shared Workers_](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124750/web), service workers that can be shared between browsing contexts. We can expect [Web Push](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124751/web) support in 2023, too.
    
*   [Astro 1.0 was expected this week](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124752/web) but the release of [the novel static site builder](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124753/web) is being pushed back to late July.
    
*   GitHub is introducing [the idea of Achievements](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/124754/web) where you earn badges for achieving as yet undefined goals.
