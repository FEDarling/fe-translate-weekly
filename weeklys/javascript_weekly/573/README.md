⁉️ If the subject of this issue has got you confused, it's a reference to the infamous [Wat video](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118835/web) of 2012 which we mention a couple of times in the issue today :-)

[TypeScript Features to Avoid?](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118850/web "www.executeprogram.com") — Remember Gary Bernardt’s [Wat](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118835/web) video from ten years ago? He created the [Execute Program](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118851/web) dev education platform and now reflects on four things in TypeScript to seriously think about: enums, namespaces, decorators, and `private`. It's opinionated - naturally!

[Remix vs Next.js](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118855/web "remix.run") — [Remix](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118886/web) is the new kid on the JavaScript full-stack framework block so naturally it gets compared to other things like Next.js (and even Ruby on Rails). Bear in mind that this comparison comes from the Remix team themselves but is well written while, of course, promoting the Remix approach.
