Veni, vidi, formatae! [Announcing Rome Formatter: Super Fast JavaScript Formatting](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122096/web "rome.tools") — [Rome](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122097/web) is an ambitious project that sets out to replace a _lot_ of JS tools in one hit. But Rome _wasn’t_ [built in a day,](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122098/web) so they’re unveiling their take on _Prettier_\-esque code formatting first. You can use it from the CLI but they’re recommending [this VS Code extension](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122099/web) primarily as a way to get a taste.

[Announcing RedwoodJS 1.0 and $1M Funding](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122104/web "tom.preston-werner.com") — Tom, formerly a co-founder of GitHub, announces the 1.0 release of [RedwoodJS](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122105/web), a full-stack framework perhaps originally best associated with the [Jamstack](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122106/web) but is essentially a React and GraphQL-powered framework for building whatever apps you’d like.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   The British government has removed jQuery as a dependency from its [gov.uk](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122108/web) frontend apps – Matt Hobbs [shows off how this improves performance](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122109/web) significantly.
    
*   If you use AWS Lambda for running serverless functions, you can now get [direct HTTPS URLs](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122110/web) for triggering functions, rather than having to use API Gateway. _Serverless Framework_ [already supports them](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122111/web) too. (_→ [via Serverless Status](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122156/web)_)
    
*   [Node 12.22.12 (LTS)](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122112/web) is out and it's the _last Node 12 ever_ 👋 [Node 17.9.0 (Current)](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122113/web) is also out, but is a minor release.
    
*   [Almost a third of the top 35 npm packages remain at risk](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122114/web) due to a lack of 2FA use by associated accounts.
    
*   A developer makes the argument that [JavaScript is safer for programming with integers than modern C](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/122115/web) – it's no April Fool.
