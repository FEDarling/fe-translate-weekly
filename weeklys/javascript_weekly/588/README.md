[How Partytown Eliminates Website Bloat From Third-Party Scripts](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123216/web "www.smashingmagazine.com") — As well as being the name of my house, [Partytown](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123217/web) is also a library for moving the execution of scripts into the background via [Web Workers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123218/web) thus freeing up your main thread. Why does that matter? Let Steve tell you.

[Ryan Dahl on 'JavaScript Containers'](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123219/web "tinyclouds.org") — Ryan, originally known for Node and now [Deno](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123220/web), thinks about JavaScript as being a universal scripting language and how the JS sandbox acts as a sort of high level version of the traditional Linux container and will only become more important in the next few years.

[Why I Don’t Miss React](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123222/web "www.jackfranklin.co.uk") — _Not_ a call to drop React, a declaration of it being ‘dead’, or that all frameworks are useless, but the author went from using React every day to not using it at all, and had a more pleasant time than he was expecting.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   [TodoMVC](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123274/web) is a long standing project showing how a ToDo app can be built in numerous frameworks. But what about _no_ framework? Marc Grabanski [shows us TodoMVC in vanilla JS](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123275/web) in 2022.
    
*   I'm seeing a _lot_ of library and tool releases explicitly dropping Node 12 support in their latest versions, so if you're still using Node 12 anywhere, upgrade ASAP (or, at least, take a lot of care when updating dependencies).
    
*   [Node 18.1.0](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123224/web) has been released and includes [a new test running feature](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123225/web) on the CLI: `node --test` _(Be sure to see [Node Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/123226/web) for more on Node.)_
