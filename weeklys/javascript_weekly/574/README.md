[A Pipe Operator for JavaScript: Introduction and Use Cases](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119185/web "2ality.com") — In the State of JS 2020 survey, a _lot_ of developers felt a pipe operator was missing from JavaScript. It’s been around a while, but there’s a [pipeline operator proposal](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119186/web) and it’s at stage two of the TC39 process. Dr. Axel explains why you’d want this, how it can work, and why JS _won’t_ get F# style pipes.

[On Porting the TypeScript Compiler to Go (vs Rust)](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119145/web "kdy1.dev") — The author is a Rust advocate (who created [swc](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119146/web)) but recognizes that Go might be a better tool particularly for building the _type checker_ and explains why here. This post also fuelled a rather [extensive Hacker News discussion](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119147/web) on the complications involved with many coming to Rust's defence.

[Take the State of JavaScript 2022 Survey](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119149/web "stateofjs.com") — Now several years in, the popular State of JavaScript survey returns for a joint 2021/22 run and, as ever, seeks to establish what libraries and frameworks developers are excited about. It’s not a perfect approach, but the results are interesting to compare year to year, and we’ll share the results once they’re out.

**IN BRIEF:**

*   ⭐️ An engineer at Etsy [mentions Etsy migrated](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119150/web) all their React 15.6 code to [Preact](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119151/web) rather than going to React 16+. A [doc from 2020](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119194/web) explained some of the internal thinking around this choice.
    
*   The Deno team has [reflected on Deno's progress in 2021.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119187/web) The [Angular team has done similarly,](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119188/web) too.
    
*   [TypeScript 4.6 is in beta](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119152/web) and focused on relatively minor technical enhancements, such as improved errors, a trace analyzer, and allowing code in constructors _prior_ to calling `super()`.
    
*   Ryan Florence of the Remix project notes on Twitter a _["palpable feeling that folks are ready for the post-React world"](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119153/web)_.
    
*   Mike Melanson asks [if 2022 will be a 'golden age' for full-stack JavaScript](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/119154/web)?
