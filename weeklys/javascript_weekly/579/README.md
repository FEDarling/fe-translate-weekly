[The Easiest Way to Monitor Node: Automatic Instrumentation](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/120560/web "blog.appsignal.com") — Monitoring your Node.js apps can be hard. You need to understand what you need to monitor, instrument code, and then make sense of all the data. Automatic instrumentation makes that whole process easier and streamlined. Find out how you can do it.

## **IN BRIEF:**

*   🇺🇦 The popular [Leaflet](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/120561/web) mapping library was created by a Ukrainian [developer](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/120562/web) and [the Leaflet team has a message for JavaScript developers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/120563/web) about the current invasion and things you can do to help Ukraine. We, too, have donated and will continue to do so. GitHub has also shared [their response to the war.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/120564/web)
    
*   Another month, [another VS Code release.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/120565/web) This time we get improved automatic language detection, lazy variable evaluation when debugging JS (and JS only, for now), and improved syntax error reporting in JS files.
