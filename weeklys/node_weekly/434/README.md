[Node.js 18 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122584/web "nodejs.org") — Almost exactly one year after Node 16 and two after Node 14 comes the newest version of Node. It’s a ‘current’ branch release for now, but will become an LTS (Long-Term Support) release in October, and you can expect it to be supported till 2025. What’s new?

*   As the new 'current' release, Node 18 will get all the fancy new features first, until October 2022.
*   The Fetch API, backed by [Undici](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122585/web) is now available globally by default. Say hello to (and be aware of) `fetch`, `Request`, `Response` and other new globals.
*   The [Web Streams API](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122586/web) is now exposed on the global scope, as are `Blob` and `BroadcastChannel`.
*   The `node:test` [test runner module.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122587/web)
*   If you like laundry lists, the [official release post](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122588/web) by Beth Griggs is well worth working through too.

[Four Reasons to Avoid using `npm link`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122591/web "hirok.io") — `npm link` can be used to symlink a local package as a dependency during development, but the author has created the `link` package (which you can use via `npx`) as a safer and ‘more predictable’ alternative. All is explained within.

▶  [Writing a Node App with ClojureScript and `nbb`](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122596/web "www.youtube.com") — If you think of Node as a runtime rather than something that must absolutely be JavaScript-based, the title makes sense. The guys in the video use [nbb](https://nodeweekly.com/link/122597/web), a Node-based scripting environment for ClojureScript. As an aside, it’s quite cool to see two developers working together within the same screencast.
