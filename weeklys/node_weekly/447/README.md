[Payload 1.0: A Headless CMS Platform Built on Node](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126518/web "payloadcms.com") — An exciting project that appeared in early 2021 [with a bang](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126519/web) then [became open source](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126520/web) just a couple of months ago. There’s a lot to like about Payload if you need a headless CMS including a customizable React-based admin system, GraphQL _or_ REST APIs, flexible auth and file upload systems, and it’s very easy to [get started.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126521/web) [GitHub repo](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126522/web).

[An Introduction to Multithreading in Node.js](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126524/web "blog.appsignal.com") — Node’s concurrency story is mostly oriented around a single thread and an event loop, but [worker threads](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126525/web), first introduced in Node 10, open the door to a more classical multithreaded concurrency approach. This post covers them at a high level with just enough to help you decide if they make sense for you or not.

[Testing Bun's Speed and Compatibility with Node.js](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126526/web "techsparx.com") — David decided to put [Bun](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126527/web) (a much celebrated newcomer to the JS runtime world) through its paces to see how it would fare with a real world app vs Node.js. Unsurprisingly for an app with real world pressures (file system, network, et al.) the difference in performance was minor, but he was impressed at how seamlessly it worked. _(Update: Pay attention to the update on this article as the methodology had a fatal flaw..)_
