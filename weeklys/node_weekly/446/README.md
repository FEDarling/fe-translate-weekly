[Custom ESM Loaders: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126240/web "dev.to") — That’s a _lot_ of questions! _Custom loaders_ aren’t necessarily something you’ll use directly a lot, but are useful behind the scenes for controlling how modules are loaded – this post shows off some examples. Node 18.6 now also provides a mechanism for chaining together multiple such loaders.

[Optimizing Node.js Dependencies in AWS Lambda](https://nodeweekly.com/link/126249/web "aws.amazon.com") — Node.js was the first runtime that AWS’s _Lambda_ serverless platform supported and it’s still a fantastic fit.
