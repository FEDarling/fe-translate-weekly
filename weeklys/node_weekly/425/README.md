[Express.js 5.0 Now in Beta](https://nodeweekly.com/link/119862/web "github.com") — Considering that the first _alpha_ of 5.0 was over _seven_ years ago, this is a big step for the still wildly popular Web app library.

[Node v17.5.0 (Current) Released](https://nodeweekly.com/link/119864/web "nodejs.org") — Sadly this release dropped just hours after last week’s issue of Node Weekly, but this is the first release of Node with native (though currently experimental behind the `--experimental-fetch` option) Fetch API support ([more on what that means here](https://nodeweekly.com/link/119865/web)) so give it a spin.

🧑‍⚖️  [Node.js Trademarks Transferred to the OpenJS Foundation](https://nodeweekly.com/link/119867/web "openjsf.org") — You may not have realized this, but Joyent (a company that heavily backed the early development of Node) still owned the Node.js trademark till, well, now. We appreciate having had their kind permission to use the term ‘Node’ in the name of this newsletter – now the OpenJS Foundation takes on the legal responsibilities.
