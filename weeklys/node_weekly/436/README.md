*   Dr. Axel Rauschmayer [makes the point](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123146/web) (picked up from Guy Bedford) that now Node.js 12 is at its 'end of life', we wave goodbye to the final version of Node that didn't have ES module support from the start.
    
*   On the topic of ES modules in Node, however, James M Snell [also notes](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123147/web) that it has thrown 'a giant monkey wrench into the ecosystem' and there [are](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123148/web) _"going to be large chunks of npm that you just can't use because it's just not going to be a good experience."_
    
*   [Node 14.19.2 (LTS)](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123149/web) has been released.
