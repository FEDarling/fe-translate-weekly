## The Best of Node Weekly in 2021

This is the last issue of the year (we're back on January 13 as we're taking a two week break) so we're taking a look back at some of the most popular links that we've shared throughout 2021. There's bound to be a few that escaped your attention at the time :-)

1: [Ask HN: Why is Node.js 'Hated' So Much?](https://nodeweekly.com/link/117820/web "news.ycombinator.com") — Ok, this one _clearly_ caught your attention. We shared this Hacker News discussion [back in October](https://nodeweekly.com/link/117821/web) and there's plenty of comments to look over here – many fair, some not. We said at the time that it's best to remain philosophical on things like this and remember C++’s creator who said: _“There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.”_

2: [Guidelines for Choosing a Node.js Framework](https://nodeweekly.com/link/117822/web "simonplend.com") — Hapi? Koa? Express? Slow down. Unlike a lot of articles, this one from late September doesn’t give you _any_ specific framework suggestions, but instead arms you with what you should be looking at when weighing up your options.

[Node.js 框架选择指南](./nodejs_framework_selection_guide.md) Hapi? Koa? Express? 别着急。与许多文章不同，这篇来自 9 月下旬的文章没有为你提供任何具体的框架建议，而是为你提供在选择框架时应该考虑的内容。
