[An Enhanced 2FA Experience for Your `npm` Account](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123442/web "github.blog") — Over the past six months, GitHub has been keen to tighten up security around the publishing of `npm` packages with two-factor authentication at the heart of the effort. Now an array of improved 2FA features are in public beta for you to try out, but all maintainers of the top 500 npm packages will be enrolled in a mandatory fashion on May 31.

The Register

**Quick bytes:**

*   📅 [NodeConf EU](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123448/web) is taking place this October 3-5 in Ireland. There's a [call for speakers](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123449/web) open until July 6 if you want to speak.

*   A common reason for new Node releases is the discovery of vulnerabilities in key dependencies like OpenSSL or (rarely) V8. OpenSSL has a new _low_ severity one explained [in this post by Rafael Gonzaga](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123452/web) but it's not significant enough to trigger new Node releases at this time.
    
*   [Node 16 LTS](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123453/web) is now available on Vercel. Official AWS Lambda support is also [just around the corner..](https://nodeweekly.com/link/123454/web)
