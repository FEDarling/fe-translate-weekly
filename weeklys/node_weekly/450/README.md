Sort of.](https://nodeweekly.com/link/127515/web "github.com") — The term ‘native module’ often refers to core Node.js modules like `fs` but sometimes gets used to describe third party native addons _too._ To resolve the confusion, Node.js is switching to calling built-in modules as “built-ins” or “built-in modules” and dynamically linked native addons as “addons.” Now _we_ just need to remember.. 😁
