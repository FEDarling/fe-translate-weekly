📱 Mobile Dev Weekly

Last week [Apple announced plans for new child safety features in iOS](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112406/web). These upcoming changes include safety tools in Messages, new Siri and Search information, and CSAM detection. The latter is a new content-scanning technology on US iCloud uploads — Apple has shared [a technical summary on how this will work here](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112407/web).

This planned detection technology, albeit well intentioned, has [proved somewhat controversial](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112408/web) however, with many seeing it as a potential backdoor of sorts to device surveillance. So widespread was [the concern](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112409/web) around this feature [that Apple published a follow-up FAQ late Sunday](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112410/web). An [open-letter calling on the company to halt its plans](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112411/web) has gained nearly 8,000 signatures at time of writing.

There's plenty of nuance and details to consider here — I found the [latest episode of the Upgrade podcast](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112412/web) to do a good job in covering this topic in-depth, and [John Gruber's write-up](https://mobiledevweekly.com/link/112413/web) is also worth a read.
