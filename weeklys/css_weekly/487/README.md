Issue #487: Year in Review
==========================

January 7, 2022

![Happy New Year 2022](https://css-weekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cssweekly-issue487-year-in-review.jpg)

Firstly and most importantly, thank you for following and reading CSS Weekly. Your (yes, \*your\*) comments, messages, and support are the reason that I’m still working on this newsletter for almost 10 years.

2021 was challenging for me personally, and I couldn’t spend nearly enough time working on the content and newsletter as I would have liked.

I’ve published only 46 issues, which is probably the lowest number of issues in a year since I’ve started CSS Weekly.

Stats
-----

The audience grew by 700 people, which means that there are now more than 33,500 people subscribed to CSS Weekly. I’m still amazed, humbled, and thankful that so many of you find the newsletter valuable enough to keep in your inbox every week.

In 2021 I featured the work of more than 200 different individuals. Some that stand out by the amount of incredible work they’ve done are in the table below.

A big thank you to everyone creating CSS-related content, both individuals and teams.

If you (yes, \*you\*) ever write an article or create something that you think could be interesting for CSS Weekly, [send it to me](https://css-weekly.com/submit-a-link/). Even though there is limited space in the newsletter, I read and consider every submitted link.

Supporters & Sponsors
---------------------

CSS Weekly is financially sustainable through ads and many wonderful individuals who contribute financially.

### Supporters

The newsletter is actively supported by 30 individuals on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cssweekly?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-487&utm_medium=email). A huge thanks to each and every one of them. Even a small pledge makes a difference.

Currently, the only benefit of being a supporter is that you get an ad-free newsletter and your profile shown on the [Supporters page](https://css-weekly.com/supporters/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-487&utm_medium=email), but I’m actively looking to expand this and offer more benefits.

### Sponsors

In 2021 CSS Weekly had about 20 different sponsors, with the biggest one being [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-487&utm_medium=email). Thank you, Brad, Marci, and the entire team, It’s pleasure working with you.

I’m looking for long-term sponsors for 2022, especially for Q1 and Q2. If you want to reach 33,000+ front-end developers and designers, increase your brand awareness and build trust with your perfect audience, [get in touch](https://css-weekly.com/advertise/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-487&utm_medium=email). I would love to work with you.

Plans for 2022
--------------

This year, I will focus full-time on CSS Weekly with the goal to provide as much educational material related to CSS as possible.

I’ll be creating original content on and off-site (more on that soon), and I’ll share much more on social media: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CSSWeekly), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cssweekly/), & [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CSSWeekly/).

### Prettier + Stylelint Course

I’ve started working on my first premium course. It’s on integrating Prettier & Stylelint into your workflow to have CSS across your team (and even organization) consistent and automatically formatted while catching bugs and problems in your stylesheets.

I don’t have any specific info on the launch date or the exact course outline just yet, but if you want to learn more, hit the button below and you’ll be the first to know the details. (I will kindly ask you to answer 3 simple questions to help me tailor the course for you and your needs better.)

[Keep me up to date with your Prettier + Stylelint course →](https://sprw.io/stt-26e4f7)

Until Next Week
---------------

May your days be fulfilled, meaningful, and remarkable, your stylesheets clean, maintainable, and !important-free!

Here’s to a fantastic 2022! 🥂
