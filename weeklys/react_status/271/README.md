▶  [A Recap of React Conf 2021](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118282/web "reactjs.org") — React Conf took place online for the first time in 2021 and this is a fantastic summary of what took place along with videos of the talks and why you might watch some of them. The [main keynote](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118283/web) covered the state of concurrency, Suspense, server components, React Native, and more.

[A Visual Guide to `useEffect`](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118284/web "alexsidorenko.com") — We have featured previous instalments of the author’s _Visual Guide to React Rendering_ series (see `[useMemo](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118285/web)` and `[Props](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118286/web)` for example) and now he turns his attention to `useEffect`. His illustration of these concepts through a series of GIFs is both clever and effective, particularly for visual learners. There's also [a visualization of how first class functions work](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118287/web) if you want more.

[On React Project Layout](https://react.statuscode.com/link/118290/web "blog.testdouble.com") — The author makes the case that the layout of the `src` directory should be more standardized, similar to the approach taken by the highly opinionated _Ruby on Rails_. Here is his proposal for making this directory something other than the ‘wild west’.
