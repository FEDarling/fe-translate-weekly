[An RFC for `useEvent`, a New Fundamental React Hook](https://react.statuscode.com/link/123341/web "github.com") — Billed as a so-far ‘missing piece’ of the hooks system, the proposed `useEvent` is for defining an event handler that ‘sees’ fresh props/state but has a stable function identity. The motivation and use cases are shown off here and the React team is open to your feedback.

James Brightman [also thinks about it](https://react.statuscode.com/link/123343/web) and thinks it’ll eventually _“change the way you write modern React.”_
