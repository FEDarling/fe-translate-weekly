[React 18.0 Released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121610/web "reactjs.org") — Almost a year ago, [the plan](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121611/web) was for 18 to be simple to upgrade to with minimal changes needed – and despite the introduction of a new concurrent rendered, Suspense, new hooks, automatic batching, and more (all covered in this news post) they’ve pretty much nailed it. [This React 18 upgrade guide](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121612/web) covers the few things you need to consider, and if you’re a true completist, [this changelog](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121613/web) covers every tiny change.

[When Does React Render Your Component?](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121615/web "www.zhenghao.io") — If you’re still a little flummoxed by React rendering behaviour, this takes another crack at explaining it by walking the fine line between superficial overview and technical deep dive.

▶  [The Story of Next.js](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121616/web "www.youtube.com") — A good balance of detail and high level overview to tell the [Next.js](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121617/web) story. Despite being just 12 minutes long, it goes into a lot more background and history than you’d expect, too.

[Remix: The Yang to React's Yin?](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121618/web "kentcdodds.com") — Kent C. Dodds continues to flesh out [Remix](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121619/web)’s _raison d’etre_ with another insightful blog post: this time talking about React’s UI building _yin_ as compared to Remix’s ‘Network Chasm’ _yang_, which he broadly defines as everything between the client and the server.

## **Quick bits:**

*   📅 [React Norway](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121621/web) is a React event taking place in the curiously-named [Farris Bad](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121622/web) hotel in beautiful Larvik, Norway. You can attend virtually online too for a nominal sum, but who doesn't want to meet [Colby Fayock](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121623/web) in person?

[react-custom-roulette: A Roulette Wheel, Complete with Spinning](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121628/web "github.com") — We don’t want to condone gambling or anything, but the ‘spinning wheel’ is a compelling effect in lots of situations, and this brings a highly customizable wheel to the table in the form of a React component.

## 😎 A neat RSS reader project

Quite often, readers will write in to us (you can do this by hitting reply to any issue) to ask if we'll link to their latest React-powered project. We often grant this request but sometimes a project seems merely created _with_ React, but isn't open source or particularly relevant in terms of a React newsletter. This week we have a nice exception!

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpress/image/upload/w_1280,e_sharpen:60/lmcsy49oky7lz97gjikp.jpg)](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121639/web)

[Reams](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121639/web), by Adam Butler, is a React Native-powered RSS reader (remember those?) that uses AI-driven layouts to present stories in an immersive but individual style, and while it _is_ available as an app, [it's open source too](https://react.statuscode.com/link/121640/web) so you can learn from the code if you want.
