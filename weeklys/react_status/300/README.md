[Docusaurus 2.0 Released](https://react.statuscode.com/link/127100/web "docusaurus.io") — If you’ve not used Docusaurus yourself, you’ve almost certainly read sites built with it – _it’s everywhere_! After four years of effort, [version 2.0](https://react.statuscode.com/link/127101/web) of the popular React-powered documentation-_focused_ static site generator (but you could use it for other things) has dropped. This new version was rebuilt from scratch, and adds [MDX](https://react.statuscode.com/link/127102/web) support, a new plugin system, theming, dark mode, SPA navigation, offline support, and more. _Roar!_

## **Quick bits:**

*   3️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ Talking of dinosaurs, we've made it to issue 300! It's been fun doing React Status so far. Thanks for reading - I know some of you have been here since [issue 1](https://react.statuscode.com/link/127105/web) (which now looks amazingly spartan in comparison)! :-)
    
*   The Discord team has announced [it's moving to React Native](https://react.statuscode.com/link/127106/web) for their Android app for improved consistency across platforms.
    
[Using the `useState` Hook with TypeScript](https://react.statuscode.com/link/127108/web "www.robinwieruch.de") — A quick example. _“Mostly you can rely on TypeScript’s ability to automatically infer the type. However, sometimes you need to use type arguments from TypeScript to help the TS compiler out.”_
